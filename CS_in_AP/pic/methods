Fast astronomical photometry of variable stars

Super-resolution of astronomical images

Artificial intelligence in the analysis of astronomical data
The newly discovered Kepler-90i (a sizzling hot, rocky planet that orbits its star once every 14.4 days) was found using machine
learning from Google during searching through archived Kepler data - an approach to artificial intelligence in which
computers learn to identify planets

Data mining in astronomy
Cross--identification solves the problem of connecting the source list in observational data to the source
list in data archives and catalogs
Cross-correlation which makes new discoveries possible based on the analysis of already existing data
Nearest- Neighbor Identification which is estimating the photometric redshifts of galaxies or quasars by
application of clustering algorithms in a multi-dimensional parameter space
Systematic Data Exploration which is the- application of specific queries to a database to make a discovery
of new objects or a new class of objects

Visualization of astronomical data
Data is being collected increasingly often during a single observation, which creates new
challenges for data interpretation.
